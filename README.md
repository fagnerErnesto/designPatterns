# **Study about design patterns by GoF (Gang of Four), applied to PHP 7.**

The code was written using PHP 7.1 rules, and organized by type of patterns: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

Inside each path exist a path named by pattern. Each path contains PHP classes and a class diagram from the pattern (argoUML).

Has a file named DesignPatterns.mm, it's a mind map which was written (language pt_BR) using freeMind, above I added some links to download apps and complementary reading.
